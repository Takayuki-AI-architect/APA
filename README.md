# APA – Apocrypha Prompt Architect

APA is a lightweight experimental tool for **context-aware prompt construction**.

It focuses on **cultural and semantic context completion** before image generation,
helping reduce unintended mismatches between user intent and generated output.

## Purpose
- This project does **not** define correctness or ethics.
- It does **not** enforce rules or restrictions.
- It simply assists users in **making implicit context explicit**.

## Status
- Experimental / personal research
- No guarantees
- No obligation to use

## Motivation
In generative systems, many failures are not errors but **misreadings**.
APA explores whether lightweight context completion can reduce such friction.
